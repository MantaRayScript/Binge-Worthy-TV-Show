# BINGE-WORTHY TV SHOW

## Description of the challenge

The Binge-worthy TV Show is a challenge from [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/challenges) challenges. Participation includes building an incredible landing page that celebrates the show we love and think it's Binge-watch worthy.

## Description of the project

I decided to create a one-page landing page for the Supernatural TV Show. It is one of my favorites TV shows, besides I believe it pushes creativity to the limits and I would like to use my skills in graphics as well as my new skills in programming.<br>
I decided to use Flexbox to this project and I want to use BEM for naming the classes to get used to it. What's more, I would like to use my new knowledge of naming the commits I do while creating this site.
